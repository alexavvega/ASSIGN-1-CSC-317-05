        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id = "first">The subject I am really looking forward to this semester is <em>web-development</em>!
        I'm interested in it as I have experience in web-development and I'm looking to <i>expand my knowledge in this area</i>.
        My goal is to try and create 3D models with spline and use it into my website.
        </p>
        <p id = "second">
            One of the websites that actually inspired me to incorportate 3D models into my website is <a href = "https://unseen.co/">Unseen Studio</a>.
            It was one of the first websites that I had seen and it has always been my end goal to create an interactive website like that.
            I'm experienced with HTML and CSS, but I'm looking to learn more about JavaScript!
        </p>
